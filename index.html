        		<h1>Welcome to Yi (Grace) Wang's Homepage</h1>
				<p>I am an assistant Professor of Mathematics at the California State University - Dominguez Hills. I received my M.S. in Statistics and Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota. Between 2012 and 2015, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) and a visiting assistant professor at the Mathematics Department, Duke University. From 2015, I joined the Department of Mathematics, Syracuse University.

My research interests lie in computational harmonic analysis, machine learning, signal and image processing and their applications to real data.  In particular, I am interested in analyzing data lying (locally) around some low-dimensional linear subspace and time-dependent signals (especially medical signals).

I have received an NIH award for my research.</p>
