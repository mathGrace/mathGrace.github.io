       <h1>Welcome to Yi (Grace) Wang's Homepage</h1>
	<p>	I received my M.S. in Statistics and Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota. 
				Between 2012 and 2015, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical 
				Sciences Institute (SAMSI) and a visiting assistant professor at the Mathematics Department, 
				Duke University. After that, I was an assistant professor at the Department of Mathematics,
				Syracuse University. In 2018, I joined California State University
				- Dominguez Hills as an assistant Professor of Mathematics. </p>

        <p>  My research interests lie in computational harmonic analysis, machine learning, 
					signal and image processing and their applications to real data. 
					In particular, I am interested in analyzing data lying (locally) around some low-dimensional
					linear subspace and time-dependent signals (especially medical signals). </p>

        <p>I have received an NIH award for my research. </p>
