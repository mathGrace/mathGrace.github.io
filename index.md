My research interests lie in computational harmonic analysis, machine learning,
signal and image processing and their applications to real data. 
In particular, I am interested in analyzing data lying (locally) around some low-dimensional
linear subspace and time-dependent signals. I am also working on automated decision making in health care, i.e., analyzing medical data using machine learning techniques to make fast, inexpensive and objective decisions. Read [more](research).

Research opportunities are available. If you are interested, shoot me an email or stop by my office.
