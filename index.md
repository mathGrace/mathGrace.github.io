### Research
- computational harmonic analysis
- machine learning
- signal and image processing
- real-data applications 

In particular, I am interested in analyzing data lying (locally) around some low-dimensional
linear **subspace** and **time-dependent signals**. I am also working on **automated decision making in health care**, i.e., analyzing medical data using machine learning techniques to make fast, inexpensive and objective decisions. Read [more](research).

A full publication list can be found [here](publications) and my **google scholar** profile is [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=71HiUPcAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research opportunities** are available. If you are interested, shoot me an email or stop by my office.
